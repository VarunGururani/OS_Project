✨ Features
✅ Interactive GUI with step-by-step simulation
✅ Supports FIFO & LRU page replacement algorithms
✅ Visualizes page faults, hits, and memory allocation
✅ Customizable memory size & page sequences
✅ Real-time stats (fault count, fault rate)

⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-management-visualizer.git
cd memory-management-visualizer
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
pip install matplotlib numpy
Run the visualizer

bash
Copy
python visualizer.py
🖥️ Usage
Configure settings (optional):

Modify config.py to change memory size or page sequence.

Interact with the GUI:

▶️ Next/◀️ Previous: Step through page requests

🔄 Toggle Algorithm: Switch between FIFO and LRU

📊 Stats Panel: View fault count and algorithm performance

UI Demo

📊 Algorithms
Algorithm	Description	When to Use
FIFO	Replaces the oldest page in memory	Simple systems, low overhead
LRU	Replaces the least recently used page	Better performance, higher accuracy
